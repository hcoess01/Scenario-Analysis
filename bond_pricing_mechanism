# Function to calculate bond price

    Calculate the price of a bond.

    Parameters:
    face_value (float): The bond's face value (typically 1000).
    coupon_rate (float): The bond's annual coupon rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.06 for 6%).
    discount_rate (float): The market's discount rate (or required rate of return) as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
    years_to_maturity (int): The number of years until the bond matures.
    payment_frequency (str): The frequency of coupon payments ("annual" or "semi-annual").
    
    Returns:
    float: The price of the bond.
